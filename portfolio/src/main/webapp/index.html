      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Many of my interests include watching horror movies, 
          playing video games and listening to different types of music.</p>
      <p>I have such a huge passion for technology and gaming 
          that I am working towards becoming a game designer. I want to create unique experiences 
          that portray the same inspiration and excitement that I had when I first started playing games.</p>
